1. File Size Scaling Analysis

Testing different file sizes with 512-byte buffer:
1MB file: 0.327 seconds (327189 microseconds)
10MB file: 2.784 seconds (2.78386e+06 microseconds)
50MB file: 12.238 seconds (1.22384e+07 microseconds)
100MB file: 26.546 seconds (2.65455e+07 microseconds)

The transfer time scales linearly with file size, which makes sense because each MB needs the same amount of requests and I/O work. This shows the file transfer works correctly because it has an exponential trend. 

File Size vs Transfer Time (256-byte buffer)

Time (s)
30 |                                                    * (100MB, 26.5s)
25 |
20 |
15 |                          * (50MB, 12.2s)
10 |
5  |         * (10MB, 2.8s)
0  |  * (1MB, 0.3s)
   +--------------------------------------------------
      0        20        40        60        80       100  File Size (MB)

2. Main Bottleneck Analysis

Testing 100MB file with different buffer sizes:
Buffer = 64 bytes: 28.64 seconds (3.2M messages)
Buffer = 128 bytes: 16.39 seconds (1.6M messages) 
Buffer = 256 bytes: 10.28 seconds (819K messages)
Buffer = 512 bytes: 10.09 seconds (819K messages)
Buffer = 1024 bytes: 10.12 seconds (819K messages)
Buffer = 2048 bytes: 10.16 seconds (819K messages)

With small buffers (64 bytes), it took 29 seconds and needed 3.2 million messages. Performance improved a lot up to 256 bytes, but then plateaued around 10 seconds for larger buffers.

Looking at the system stats, most time gets spent in system calls rather than actual work. With 64-byte buffers: 18.90 seconds in system calls vs 9.41 seconds user time. This shows the bottleneck is all the back-and-forth communication between client and server.

CONCLUSION:

The main bottleneck is communication protocol overhead. Small buffers waste time with too many messages, but even with optimal buffers, the request-response design limits how fast you can go.
